# citi-bike-new-york
Final academic team project for *"Data Science: R"*, a curricular course attended throughout the fall semester of my second master's degree in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School. 
My team and I have analyzed the consumer's behavior towards the use of *"Citi Bike"* in *New York City* (NYC) from 2018 to 2020, focusing on modeling and communication. By conducting our research we had the opportunity to *improve our skills* in the following *areas*:
- Variable Selection
- Data collection
- Data Analysis (Summarization and Visualization)
- Outliers Identification
- OLS Modelling
- Results Communication
- R Markdown
